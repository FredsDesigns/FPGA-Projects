# FPGA-Projects
Here is a collection of FPGA Projects I have done. Languages used varies between VHDL or SystemVerilog. Systems also vary between Altera and Xilinx Boards.

I'd highly advise you to first checkout my 8-bit adder/subtractor project. It highlights how the VHDL language is used, and the process necessary to recreate the full-adder system in VHDL form. Not only that but I tried to keep it as beginner friendly so if this is your first time using VHDL, it will walk you through terminology used in the code itself, and what each bit does.
